Extending GeekyRemB
Developers can enhance and expand GeekyRemB by adding new features, optimizing existing ones, or integrating additional functionalities. Below are guidelines and best practices to assist in development:

Adding New Animation Types
To introduce a new animation type:

Define the Animation in the AnimationType Enum:

python
Copy code
class AnimationType(Enum):
    NEW_ANIMATION = "new_animation"
    # Existing animations...
Implement the Animation Logic in EnhancedAnimator.animate_element:

python
Copy code
elif animation_type == AnimationType.NEW_ANIMATION.value:
    # Define how the element should animate
    x += int(math.sin(progress * math.pi) * amplitude)
    y += int(math.cos(progress * math.pi) * amplitude)
    # Any additional transformations
Update the INPUT_TYPES to Include the New Animation:

python
Copy code
"animation_type": ([anim.value for anim in AnimationType],),
Document the New Animation in the User Guide under the Features and Parameters Guide sections.

Optimizing Blend Modes
To add or optimize a blend mode:

Implement the Blend Mode Function in EnhancedBlendMode:

python
Copy code
@staticmethod
def new_blend_mode(target: np.ndarray, blend: np.ndarray, opacity: float = 1.0) -> np.ndarray:
    # Define the blend operation
    def blend_op(t, b):
        return (t + b) / 2  # Example operation
    return EnhancedBlendMode._apply_blend(target, blend, blend_op, opacity)
Register the Blend Mode in the get_blend_modes method:

python
Copy code
@classmethod
def get_blend_modes(cls) -> Dict[str, Callable]:
    return {
        "new_blend_mode": cls.new_blend_mode,
        # Existing blend modes...
    }
Update the INPUT_TYPES to include the new blend mode option.

Document the Blend Mode in the User Guide.
